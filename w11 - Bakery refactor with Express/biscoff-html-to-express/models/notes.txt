Trying out new tool - Mongoose
Previously: Request made -> Routes -> Controller -> DB
Now: Request made -> Routes -> Middleware(for authentication purposes) -> Controller

where we can put authentication logic in middleware, instead of in controller, 
especially if you have many controllers

Mongoose is an ODM - object document model
raw daw from database -> mongoose turns into more useful model(meaning with extended functionalities)
extra functionalities such as validation, querying

Mongoose - quick start - npm install mongoose --save

Schema - mongoose concept
set of blue prints/format which data can be entered
so that you cannot anyhow update data, with extra keyvalue pair, wrong type integer/string etc.
