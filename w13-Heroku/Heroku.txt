How to deploy Heroku
Link to github account -> Deploy
Connect to repository
Automatic Deploy - connect to main branch, then automatic deploy
(automatically update after each commit)

Manual deploy once - then it will configure the 
runtime environment, node_modules, dependencies, npm

Then Open App

Error? Check Activity Logs
Activity > Activity Feed > Build Log > No error? Build process is ok
Open App - More - > View logs
>Failed to connect to DB
>because .env file not in heroku app, cant get user n pass to connect to DB

Engine specification and procfile
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support
1. Specifying node.js and npm version
Check current version in terminal
$ node --version
$ npm --version
Then in paste below in package.json file
"engines": {
    "node": "18.x",
    "npm": "8.x"
  }

  .x is for minor version is ok, as long as major version specified
Check Activity > build log for version installed after deploy

2. Runtime behaviour - specify instruction/commands to start application
eg. we type nodemon / npm start
create a procfile in directory, copy paste web: npm start
if omit this procfile, heroku will do guess work to guess its node.js


3. Deployed to Heroku - cannot specify port in server.js
-port = process.env.PORT, assign env variable

4. App - Settings - Config Vars - reveal config variable
put in your .env varaibles here as key value pair
