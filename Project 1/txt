Qn for Jonathan:

Remove my previous bus search timing
- give a class to my div
- querySelectorAll - loop through

How to make a scrollable bus timing within the page?
Or how should i adjust my height
- % height -- doesnt work
- maybe not vh -- use vh + overflow auto (bootstrap)

Tooltip out of window

Refresh - how will it work -done

Sticky Nav - done for footer and nav

To work on - shifting bus section + search bar to sticky nav
To work on - tool tip
