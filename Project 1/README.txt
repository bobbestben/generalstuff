Project Description
Similar to the "Compare Flight Prices" application,
I want to create shopping website:
1. Search for item
2. Fetches data from both Shoppee & Lazada
3. Displays lowest prices first
4. Clicking the item you want - links you directly to the sellers page at Shoppee/Lazada
5. Complex user interace modules -> carousell for navigating pages?
    Or drag and drop into a window to KIV your purchases before you add to bookmark/cart
