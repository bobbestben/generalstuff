React - good for single page application
The way it works - when you click some thing and the page reacts,
it does not reload the whole page, but only that section
- makes pages/navigating smooth


$ npm start  - to run application
when this command run - it loads the key:value pair script in package.json

If wanna use yarn - delete package.json and node_modules

$ yarn install
a new package.json file will be installed
- eslintConfig - help check for code errors - missing ; or something


How does React page load?

In public -> index.html -> loads a <div id=root></div>

Then in index.js -> root elment with id="root" is defined here -> which renders App.js

So all your components render in App.js


## Require vs Import

Require is a Node specific syntax - need node.js
import is native syntax in latest JS version ES6
