Why use html form - vs using Javascript to code a submit button
- so if user presses "enter" on phone/keyboard, form is submitted
- dont need to manually click button (its part of the design)
- and also because its easier

Note that if use html form, and type=submit
- will be form data, need to use urlencoded
- this is a middleware

Semantic Versioning
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
major - if update, code will break [feat! commits]
minor - if code will not break [feat commits]
patch - bug fixes [fix commits]

With this convention, github can automatically generate update report via a template
System Version,
Whether is bug fix/feature/major update
And also you can trace back which pull request the version came from incase code break



## Mongol DB
Row vs column databases
You can create index for these databases, instead of using key:value pair - to speed up the querying process


### How to Start Mongol DB
run the unbuntu command to start the DB
$ sudo mongod --db ~/data/db
open new window and type mongosh - to initialize the mongo CLI environment
More reading - data design, two-way referencing and denormalization
