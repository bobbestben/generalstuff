Why use html form - vs using Javascript to code a submit button
- so if user presses "enter" on phone/keyboard, form is submitted
- dont need to manually click button (its part of the design)
- and also because its easier

Note that if use html form, and type=submit
- will be form data, need to use urlencoded
- this is a middleware
