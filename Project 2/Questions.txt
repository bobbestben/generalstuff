Passing data from database to ejs to script file:
import doesnt work for ejs
from controller -> findOne in DB -> pass as props/object to ejs file -> script file reference the object
-> can read, but error when it prints the data "&" text got problem


//JS dom - 
//Express JS - controllers

 // Getting data from database for DOM manipulation
    //give an attribute data-carpark-id
    //onclick use JS - look for carpark-id
    //with carparkMapping
    //filter
    // console.log('carpark data here', `<%- carparkMap[0]._id %>`)
    let carparkMapping = `<%- carparkMap %>` //conversion gets messy when passing object here 
    carparkMapping = JSON.parse(carparkMapping)
    console.log(carparkMapping.length)
